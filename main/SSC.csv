On-boarding of staff,28/2/2024,"I would like to propose that a functionality be implemented in the system regarding new onboarding staff members and their banking details. If it were possible, there could be a notification sent off to the employee who has not had their banking details completed in the workday system if say after 5 days of not entering the details since being onboarded. This notification could also link the QRG on how to do the banking details in workday. This would assure that no staff member is not paid as a result of forgetting/missing to complete this task, as often as I have seen, the onboarding task package in workday often does not include the banking election details. The staff member generally believes all onboarding actions to be completed once they have completed the package and task list in their workday inbox, which makes them miss these details being entered as they are trusting the system and the tasks allocated to them. This notification would serve to cover the times the banking election task is not included in the onboarding package. 

Update: Rejected - there are existing Payroll trigger reports that identify staff with missing bank details and prompt them to enter these details into Workday.",Erick Valenzuela;#313,,HR,,Low,Local C.I,Completed,Darren Norada,Darren Norada;#26,No,Yes,,Unable to implement,xSsPbMON9q8,,,1,Item,teams/SharedServiceCentre/Lists/ideasListUAT
 Efficiency = Customer Satisfaction,8/4/2024,"My process improvement is based on Communication. If we can post the information in a Team chat for important information. Pin it as important and provide the information for all team members; this will provide support, better understanding and efficient customer service. 
The team requires communication chat for information and update without the noise of the team chat. This will be a source of information and facts. Communication will provide us with more confidence when doing our job, it will avoid incorrect information and confusion and provides all our clients an effective customer service experience.

Update: SSC HR Communications chat was created on Teams on 14th August 2024. This chat is updated with important communications, changes and any key learnings discovered from interactions with other teams.

Centralised Approver Team Rejection Notification.,7/3/2024,"
As the HR SSC team is the first point of contact regarding anything that goes wrong in the University we are contacted quite often in regards to the new casual academic timesheets either pending past the approval date or those that are rejected. To my knowledge and experience with the timesheets that have been rejected by the centralised approver team there are no comments left in the rejected timesheets indicating the reason. This is okay as they are not the correct team to provide the reason and the CAAO team should be contacted to clarify the reason for the rejection. However I do believe we can alleviate many enquiries to the HR SSC team by confused staff members who have had rejections in their timesheets yet do not know where to query for the reason by having the centralised approver team provide a templated comment in the rejected timesheet advising the staff of the discrepancy and also to contact their CAAO for further information. This will give clear direction to the staff there was an issue with the timesheet submission in comparison to the OTA allocations and they will understand the contact to shed clarity on the same to be the CAAO team. They template can be as simple as below:

I feel this would improve the customer experience greatly and also reinforce the notion that we are customer supporting and not just a processing service.

"Enhancements to Workday Manage Education / Qualification Process
",26/3/2024,"Details: I gathered team feedback and held meetings with the HR EPR and Workday teams to enhance the scripting in the Workday Manage Education and Qualification process. On 28th March, the following changes to the Workday Manage Education / Qualification process went live in production:
1. If a staff member selects ‘No’ to Degree Received, indicating that their degree is in-progress, they will receive the below Error Alert and will not be able to submit their education / qualification.
2. SSC HR has been given access to a ‘Deny’ button and the denied notification will appear.
3. We now have access to a ‘Cancel’ button to cancel education tasks. This means if a staff member asks for an old in-progress task to be cancelled as it was submitted in error, our team can now cancel on their behalf

Benefits: The above enhancements will provide a clearer message to staff to provide a completed and conferred degree with acceptable certified documentation.

HR Service Now Templates,19/8/2024,"Continuous Improvement Initiative: ServiceNow Templates

Details: I held discussions and introduced the ServiceNow Templates functionality to my team. Subsequently I rolled out with training across my SSC HR team from 19th August 2024. I created a few standard templates in August that the team have started to utilise: 
- Resolve Scripting
- Follow Up
- Resolve No Response 7 Days
- Enquiry trend-based scripting: For example, Resolve PP&D Mid-Year Review, Resolve Mandatory Training Email Error

Benefits:
- ServiceNow Templates simplify the process of sending new responses to our clients by populating fields automatically. 
- It reduces time in having to type responses from scratch. 
- Ensures consistency across scripting agreed as part of the HR Operating Model and amongst the SSC HR team. 

Next steps:
- I am working with Michael in my team to incorporate 10 – 12 additional templates in ServiceNow. As part of Michael’s CI, he has created a suite of templates including recruitment, onboarding, pay, timesheets, leave, personal and position information, PP&D, OTA, Workday tasks and manager advice.

"Timesheet timestamp dashboard report
",26/3/2024,"Summary of issue – opportunity 
HR SSC receive many contacts from Casual Academics who have submitted their timesheet on time, late, and or are pending and concerned about it being reviewed and approved in time to make the current pay cycle.
At current time, we can only go off the staff members word as to when the timesheet was submitted, with no view to see when the timesheet was submitted in the system. However, can see when a timesheet has been approved. 

Continuous improvement Idea’s
1.	Timesheet submission timestamp:
a.	Time/date stamp when the client first submits the timesheet allowing SSC to verify the exact submission date as if it was submitted late, we can stand firm on our deadline and cut-off dates.
b.	Second date/time stamp for the second submission after discrepancies resolved. Where academic timesheets have errors and CAAO/CAT work with the staff to resolve, we need to view when it was re-submitted by the staff member to check if they will be paid.
Outcome: With having the above timestamps this will help SSC determine the exact date and time a timesheet has been submitted and allow us to know if it was submitted on time and can make the cut-off.  
2.	 It would be ideal for our team to know (Internal purposes only – when the Central Approver Team (CAT) Start the approving process during the timesheet submission week, and if they approve as late as Monday COB (Pay week) will that claim be paid.  

3.	A tick box within FC924 that confirms if that approved timesheet will be paid in the current cycle, we currently have a ‘pd’ tick-box but that only confirms after they have been paid. It would beneficial that when a timesheet is approved the system confirms it was approved in time for the pay cycle and marks a tick box for example ‘For Processing’ meaning if that tick box is marked it will be paid in that pay cycle, as the moment we must check with Payroll directly if a claim will be processed.  If somehow the system can detect that the timesheet was approved in time, it marks this box so if a client calls us we can be certain that yes it will be paid (box ticked) or its not ticked and we know that they have not made the payroll cut-off for processing.

4.	A Flow chart with the process re Creation, Submission, review, discrepancies; we can work with our colleagues in EPR/CAT/ Payroll to create this document to give the SSC a solid understanding of the flow to help alleviate the grey area around the process.
Ideally the submission timestamps / processing tick box would be visible in FC924 code in Ascender, where we can currently check what date, a timesheet was approved.  

Expected result/outcome.
1.	Having the time stamp implemented from a system perspective.
2.	Create an additional tick box within Ascender FC924 that confirms the approved timesheets are ‘for processing’ meaning they will make the pay cycle.
3.	Have the Flow chart created with collab with our colleagues to provide frontline staff with the information and confidence needed to answer these types of enquiries. 
I believe having the above opportunities reviewed for implementation will support our team with first call resolution. 
For example,
If SSC has clear guidelines for the absolute last day and time a timesheet can be approved in order to be paid that pay cycle, we can confirm with the client that it will go through for payment (keeping the finer details internal knowledge only of course) but it gives us the confidence in knowing their timesheet that was approved on the Monday of pay week by 7pm will make the payment run.
This will prevent us having to follow up with payroll to ask them to check if it’s made it or not, helping remove unnecessary contacts to Payroll and or the Central Approver team.

"Workday Confirmation of Employment and Statement of Service (Reference Letter) 
",1/5/2024,"Details: On 1st May 2024, after in-depth phases of exploration, build, training, and testing I had initiated, the launch of the Workday Confirmation of Employment and Statement of Service (Reference Letter) went live.

Key changes with the new process:
- Active employees will be able to self-request a Reference Letter in Workday. They can request to have their Reference Letter include compensation details, job responsibilities and/or parental leave dates. 
- HR SSC team can initiate a Reference Letter in Workday on behalf of a client.
- Workday Task Inbox has a built-in filter ‘SSC Letters’ to enable HR SSC team to easily locate Reference Letter tasks.
- Semi-automation of Reference Letter creation - Workday pulls information of an employee’s primary position, personal details, compensation (if applicable) and leave details (if applicable) and pre-populates into the Workday Reference Letter.
- Position Description can be attached as part of a client’s request to include their jobs and responsibilities.
- Workday Reference Letters are editable - can add additional information or remove pre-populated Workday information. 
- Tasks can be easily cancelled if needed (for example, a client requested a letter in error or HR SSC created a letter in error).

Benefits:
- Semi-automation of Reference Letter creation will lead to quicker turnaround by HR SSC team members not having to manually populate information into a Word template document.
- Improved accuracy with information pre-populated direct from Workday.
- Improved client experience with employees being able to self-request a Reference Letter with tailored options in Workday. Once actioned by HR SSC, they can download and print the letter anytime by navigating to their Workday profile documents section.
- Workday reporting has been built to enable insights on workload volume, time to resolve and volume of requests by business unit.

I created the below internal ServiceNow knowledge article for guidance actioning Workday tasks in relation to the new Reference Letter process:
- KB0033671 - How to action Workday Confirmation of Employment and Statement of Service (Reference Letter) tasks?

SSC Access to Sandbox,28/8/2024,"Request: (HR SCC Access to Sandbox Workday).
 
This is the second time I have been part of the Workday UAT testing and have found that the Sandbox access would be a great benefit for our team to support managers or recruiters with their functional view navigation.
Our team receives calls from Managers who request direction and support with navigating their Workday profile (specifically manager dashboard). Example yesterday was a manager who phoned needing urgent support with how to view/navigate her Workday Manager Dashboard, I was not able to help given I did not know where the data was in the manager dashboard as we do not have this view in our current access, thankfully you were able to provide me with the instruction from checking your own manager dashboard to view staff list that includes costing allocations.
 
Given there is no general article on how to use a manager dashboard, (there are only a few guides but specifically for Performance, Learning or Recruitment), I am seeking access for the Sandbox login for our HR SSC team.
 
Purpose/Outcome: The purpose of our team having access to Sandbox is not for accessing data as we are aware it is delayed information and is a testing ONLY environment, however for instances where managers call us for support on how to navigate to a certain part of their dashboard. So not only will it provide us with visibility on what the manager is seeing on their end when they call/email us,
This will allow us to confidently point them in the right direction in terms of navigating their own dashboard and helping them within a first call resolution.
 
If we are not able to gain access for our team, I think it would be ideal that a general manager dashboard guide be available to include all the basics on how to utilise the functions and reports within a dashboard and not only the current guides listed above.

Update: HR SSC access to Sandbox was not approved by Mel Quinn in Broader HR. However, she and Dipika Vohra has asked for SSC to send them all common manager queries around Workday and any related processes. They will analyse the data and make updates to the manager dashboard or knowledge articles accordingly.",Nadia Rolff;#316,,HR,,Low,Local C.I,In progress,Darren Norada,Darren Norada;#26,No,No,,,#NAME?,,,92,Item,teams/SharedServiceCentre/Lists/ideasListUAT
Survey Enhancement in Service Now,3/9/2024,"In the current ServiceNow close case survey process,  we are asking our staff to complete 5 clicks/points of contact to provide us with a survey which is a significate barrier to us receiving higher numbers of survey participants. 
I believe our current survey process within Service Now could do with a review, simplifying the process and reducing the number of clicks to help us increase our survey numbers for resolved cases. 

My idea to improve this process is to initiate the survey (direct the staff to the survey in the browser) as soon as they select ‘YES’ that the case has been resolved as shown in screenshot 1 below. 
Reducing from 5 touch points to 2. Ideally, they would click ‘Yes’ this has been resolved, then be directed straight to the survey, completing the survey before hitting submit.

Central Document Repository in Microsoft Teams: Establish a dedicated folder in Microsoft Teams for storing all relevant documents. o	Dedicated ""The Pulse of SSC (HR)"" Folder: A specific folder within the repository will be dedicated to storing all materials related to ""The Pulse of SSC (HR)"" initiative, including the fortnightly update videos and PDF versions of the presentations.  o	Additional Shared Documents: The repository will also include other shared resources such as manual timesheets, cheat sheets, training materials, and links to relevant ServiceNow articles. o	Group Calendar: A group calendar will also be included in the Microsoft Teams environment to allow team members to add birthdays and work anniversaries.

Free Printing Quota for all Students,29/8/2023,"
The University should provide every student with SydPay credit annually/every semester. Some schools have started doing this for low-SES scholarship recipients (see: RITM0514100), but I think that this is something which could be done for more students, and ideally *all* students.

The costs to the University outweighed by the tangible benefits this would provide to all students, especially those who do not receive scholarships but are still struggling with the cost of living. This would also reduce the impact & urgency of print-credit-related problems. And the reality is that much of the credit would go unused anyway.

WD Security For Legal Name Change,13/12/2024,"Hi team,

We have the security access to initiate changes on Legal names and as well approve them, however we do not have the security to cancel / deny the requests in workday. This delays the time we have spent on the tasks as we have to inform the staff how to delete / cancel the task them selves by providing a comment on how to do so. If they are not able to figure it out with the instructions we give then they will resubmit the task and go back and forth. This can be easily avoided by simply giving us the same security we have with the SOS / COE reference letters to cancel the task, which is a total of about 15 seconds to cancel with the comments included. This also allows us to spend less time communicating with the staff, more time spent on getting through all the Workday task pending review and also provides a better user experience as staff will not need to navigate and figure out how to cancel the task and reinitiate the task all over again or leave cancelled. For reference you may view case number CS1333806 as the staff selected the incorrect effective date. This cannot be altered once submitted, so a new task needs to be created, and once submitted again sent back to the que to be reviewed last of all the tasks pending review. Opposed to this being resolved right away by us cancelling and reinitiating on their behalf. Thank you for taking the time to review this CI, Erick ",Erick Valenzuela,,HR,,,,New,,,,,,,,,,239,,

Contractor Cards,19/12/2024,"UI no longer require contractor cards to be issued to contractors where they don't require building access. Each card costs $10 to print and last year we printed 3233 which is an annual cost of $32,330. It would be beneficial to reduce this cost to the University as well as reduce the time and inconvenience to contractors needing to visit G12 and paying for parking in the area etc. 

Contractors such as traffic controllers never need to access a building so do they really need a card where UI and Camden contractors do not?

As there are a number of COS contractors and sub-contractors that do not require building access, it would be great to apply the same principal to these contractors also. If they have a copy of their COS/UI Contractor completion certificate is this satisfactory for working at the University of Sydney campuses? 

If we are going to rely on the Induction completion certificate, can we ensure a copy of the certificate is emailed to their email address once the induction is completed and their ID number included on the certificate? It currently isn't currently being emailed to each contractor and the ID number isn't appearing on the certificate. 

As a longer term plan, can we come up with a new digital ID card (not digital access card as that is too hard and expensive). There are Apps such as Stocard where a template card can be created and a copy of their certificate attached. I have attached examples from my Stocard App. Or perhaps the CSMS website has an application for a digital card that contractors could upload their own photo too. 

Happy to explore other alternatives. ",Jane Bolton,,SSC,,2,,New,,,,,,,,,,241,,
AI Tool - Policy Navigator,19/12/2024,"I would like to put forward an exciting continuous improvement opportunity to potentially roll out across SSC teams with a new AI tool, ‘Policy Navigator’ (Beta release) by USYD.

I have connected with the owner, Office of General Counsel (OGC) Legal Operations team, to gain access and trial its functionality. This beta release will only be going to a limited cohort of about 200 staff to trial and provide feedback.

What is Policy Navigator?
Policy Navigator is a generative AI-backed chatbot that answers questions about the University’s official policies and Enterprise Agreement through a simple chat interface. It aims to improve access to and understanding of those documents. 
It also acts as a pilot project to help the University build and refine generative AI governance processes. 

Benefits
•	Improves access to policies and EA
•	Increases understanding to assist SSC teams when providing advice to clients
•	Drives efficiencies and less time-consuming when using the chatbot function.

Limitations
•	Policy Navigator is not and is unlikely to ever be 100% accurate – it can make mistakes. Users must verify the accuracy of its outputs by referring to the Policy Register and EA
•	Not every question has a policy answer
•	It does not currently cover the Delegations of Authority, but there is a project underway to make this available.

Project updates so far:
•	29/10/2024 - Presented idea and demo to Peter who was positive about it and recommended I showcase to Craig, Michelle, Melita and Philip
•	05/11/2024 - Presented idea and demo to Craig, Michelle, Melita and Philip. Philip to further investigate with OGC about the AI Policy Navigator functionality and information source parameters and come back with his findings.",Darren Norada,,HR,,,,New,,,,,,,,,,242,,

We have not been advised of this change and there is just old and outdated information on the KB which results in us getting an access denied error message.

Enhancing ICT Internal Knowledge Base Transfer to Service Now,23/1/2025,"The ICT internal KB is huge, and the KB transfer project requires a set plan on its transition. Planning such as separating the KB data on priority to be transferred list, stages of data migration, how to handle old/outdated KBs or information, responsibilities of new KB developer and their expectations, Plans on knowledge review, its accuracy, recordkeeping KB transfer etc. 
As the ICT internal knowledge base transitions from SharePoint to ServiceNow, establishing a standardized format for knowledge articles would greatly enhance usability and consistency. This format could include well-defined sections, such as: Service now groups, assignment groups and access/authentication, Archived/Outdated information etc. 
Having clear guidelines for creating and maintaining a standard ICT knowledge base, alongside a reliable recordkeeping system, would be beneficial the transfer process and ensure consistency. I think this will help everyone involved in the KB developers team to keep track of the KB transfer and this would also help in the reporting process of the job done.

Parental Leave Guide ,28/1/2025,"I propose developing a comprehensive Parental Leave Guide to enhance the University of Sydney's HR resources and streamline the administration of parental leave. This guide would consolidate information from multiple sources, including our Enterprise Agreement, Leave Policy and Knowledge Base articles, into a single, well-structured resource. The proposed guide would feature detailed process maps and decision trees for common scenarios, standardised response templates, and comprehensive coverage of support services. New sections would address research and academic considerations, keeping-in-touch days, and return-to-work support. While initially designed for the Shared Services Centre (SSC), the guide has potential for broader implementation across other HR teams that handle parental leave enquiries, such as HR Relationship teams and Faculty HR Partners. It would also serve as a valuable resource for SSC managers when handling escalated cases or providing guidance to their teams. Key benefits would include reduced inquiry resolution time, consistent advice across all HR functions, and improved employee experience. The guide would incorporate visual elements and practical templates to help both HR staff and employees better understand and navigate parental leave processes. This enhancement would demonstrate the University's ongoing commitment to supporting working parents and work-life balance, while also improving operational efficiency in HR service delivery. The guide would be particularly valuable for new HR team members across all areas and would serve as a single source of truth for parental leave administration.",Michael Herd,,SSC,,,,New,,,,,,,,,,257,,
ServiceNow Notifications - CSAT Survey Feedback,30/1/2025,"ServiceNow Notifications - CSAT Survey Feedback

Since the ServiceNow notification changes went live on Monday, 18 November 2024, my HR SSC team has seen a drop in CSAT survey responses in November (76), December (53) and so far in January 2025 (40). The 3 months prior to the ServiceNow notification changes, my HR SSC team were receiving on average 106 CSAT survey responses per month.

My hypothesis on why:
There is less likelihood that customers will complete a CSAT survey 7 days after the interaction 

Proposed suggestion:
When a customer accepts the satisfactory Resolution of a case, the case should be automatically set to ‘Closed’. A CSAT survey should then immediately be generated to the customer in real-time to provide their feedback.

Updates so far:
Meeting held with Peter and Emma on 21 January 2025 to flag the drop in HR CSAT survey samples since the ServiceNow notification changes went live on Monday, 18 November 2024. 
Emma to further investigate and come back with her analysis.",Darren Norada,,HR,,,,New,,,,,,,,,,258,,
CSAT post-call survey scripting,30/1/2025,"CSAT post-call survey scripting

To encourage greater customer participation and feedback in resolved call interactions, SSC team members can tag at the end of their satisfactorily resolved call interactions the below scripting:

""Thank you for your time today. I'd really appreciate if you can look out for a survey email that will come through in 7 days time following our interaction. There's no obligation but I'd really appreciate if you can take 30 seconds of your time to complete the survey on the service you were provided today. This will help us to better support clients like you in shaping our future improvements.""

This will enable greater CSAT survey participation and provide more meaningful and rich feedback. This feedback will help provide greater insights to SSC team leaders and team members on opportunities for addressing dissatisfaction immediately, knowledge upskilling, compliments reward recognition and identify continuous improvement initiatives.

Updates so far:
I have been continually reviewing the HR CSAT results towards end of month for my HR SSC team. Where the sample size is low and CSAT results are not or just meeting the goals of at least 80% CSAT and 75% CES, I have been proactively asking my HR SSC team to implement the post-call survey scripting.
I think there is an opportunity to roll this initiative out across all SSC teams to enable greater CSAT survey participation and provide more meaningful and rich feedback.",Darren Norada,,HR,,,,New,,,,,,,,,,259,,
Movement of tickets from ICT that do not have agent involvement,30/1/2025,"We currently have automated ticketing for contractor onboarding that involves a bot, and requires no input from our team to action unless there is an issue with the workflow and Sailpoint.

Support Knowledge workflow enhancement ,30/1/2025,"Problem: Current Tier 1 support articles have instructions that are largely formatted in text, meaning that the processes can get confusing, and agents get lost, resulting in overextending their support resulting in longer calls, misdirected troubleshooting, and lack of adherence to process. 

Potential solution for customer support: Start replacing our most common enquiries and the basic troubleshooting articles with workflow diagrams which show when to reassign to second level, the troubleshooting required by agents, and the information to collect on a ticket,  Pair these with links to other kbs, that will integrate the knowledge refresh project and support the idea of isolating articles to tasks.

Opportunities to Enhance the HR SSC Workday Manage Education / Qualifications Process,30/1/2025,"Opportunities to Enhance the HR SSC Workday Manage Education / Qualifications Process

Problem context:
A current pain point for the HR SSC team is verifying education or qualifications submitted by staff in Workday. Although there has been additional help text and error alerts added into Workday, there are still requests coming through without a completed and certified qualification. These requests need to be sent back to the staff member and the HR SSC team applies send back scripting from templates created. 

It can get more complex where a staff member is still mid-way through completing their qualification yet still submits the request to add it. Also, a staff member may submit multiple qualifications where not all have completed and certified degrees. For example, they submit in the 1 business process 3 qualifications but only 1 has a completed and certified degree while the other 2 need to be sent back.

Opportunities:
I have raised with Melissa Quinn, Payroll, and Dipika Vohra, Workday, recommendations:
1. If a staff member selects 'No' to Degree Received, an error alert notification should pop up and prevent the staff member from submitting the education / qualification.
2. Limit the staff member to only submit one education / qualification per business process submission.

In addition, I have met up with the AI Hub to discuss potential AI opportunities including:
1. Deploy an AI Bot to recognise missing attachments for a completed and certified qualification and 
2. Automatically suggest the appropriate Send Back template response scripting that my team and I have created.

The AI Hub will be shadowing more with my HR SSC team onsite to explore deeper the Workday functionality and deployment of the AI Bot opportunity.

Consolidated knowledge of the onboarding process ,31/1/2025,"Consolidated knowledge of the onboarding process

Currently in the SSC, the knowledge end to end of onboarding is siloed. HR, ICT, T&E and Consulting teams have their own domain understanding of the onboarding process and data system integration flows but not a whole picture. 

Opportunity:
Consolidate all onboarding process flows and teams accountable during each step of the process. This will improve clarity amongst frontline SSC teams when receiving new starter enquiries if at any point during the onboarding process there is a breakdown and which team is responsible for fixing.
